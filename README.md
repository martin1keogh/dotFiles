dotFiles
========

My dotFiles... if you're looking for a good base to build on, this is not it.

Installation
----------
-copy every file/folder to ~/.<file/folder name>
-run :BundleInstall in vim
-install tmux
-mv powerline to ~/.config/powerline

/!\ oh-my-zsh must be installed, the oh-my-zsh folder contains only the files I modified !

TODO
----
-write an install script
